todo 
-----------------
* add sourcemap to webpack
* implement rule priority
* implement rule group/flow
* more control about the rule logic, e.g. abort cycle, abort tick, etc.
* implement node change notification
* state metadata (type and stuff)
* support post event send event processing 
- send = process everything immediately & post = current behaviour where changes are added to a queue first.
